# Github's Game of Life

Github's game of life is a userscript written in vanilla javascript that allows you to perform a cellular automata simulation on your, or anyone's Github contributions map.

Works in the latest version of Firefox and Chrome, for the Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey add-ons respectively.

## Features:
- You can click on cells while the simulation is running (or paused) to 'kill' or 'revive' them
- Check the far right checkbox for some pretty colors :^)

## Example:
